Build a REST web service using one of the languages we prefer: Go, Scala, or Java. 
This RESTful service should Expose an endpoint to upload an arbitrary ASCII text file of size <= 10MB.


Parse the file (assume any uploaded file is well formatted and contains only ASCII characters) for the following information:
- The total word count
- The counts of each occurrence of a word
- Return the parsed information in the HTTP response body as JSON.

and satisfy one or more of the following:


Expose another end point that can query the system for details on every file that has been uploaded.

Remove any words from the response that contain "blue" within then, i.e. "blue," "blueberry," "bluegrass," etc.

Implement the solution without blocking I/O.

Evaluation will be based on application design, test coverage and readability of the code. 
Test coverage should demonstrate both success and failure conditions within reason. 
Included with the code should be some form of README on how to run the service and any dependencies not included (depends.txt, SBT, Maven, etc.)
